# Development Notes

## Key Differentiators & Unique Features

### 1. AI-Powered Governance Intelligence
- Custom-trained prompts for governance context understanding
- Real-time proposal analysis with scoring system (0-100)
- Context-aware discussion capabilities that remember previous interactions
- Intelligent vote decisions based on comprehensive analysis

### 2. Advanced Conviction Voting Integration
- Implementation of Polkadot's 6x conviction voting mechanism
- Automated vote weight calculation based on lock periods
- Direct on-chain vote submission with transaction verification
- Transparent voting power delegation system

### 3. Real-time Collaborative Infrastructure
- WebSocket-based live chat system for instant communication
- Concurrent proposal discussions with context preservation
- Real-time transaction status monitoring
- Instant UI updates for vote results and delegation changes

### 4. Enhanced Security Measures
- Secure wallet connection protocols
- XSS prevention in AI responses
- Encrypted WebSocket communication
- Safe delegation transaction handling

## Trade-offs & Implementation Decisions

### 1. Database Choices
- **Choice**: SQLite instead of PostgreSQL
- **Reason**: Lightweight proof-of-concept focused on functionality
- **Trade-off**: Sacrificed concurrent write performance for simplicity
- **Future**: Migration path to PostgreSQL for production scale

### 2. Frontend State Management
- **Choice**: TanStack Query over Redux
- **Reason**: Simpler server state management, reduced boilerplate
- **Trade-off**: Less control over complex client state
- **Future**: Consider Zustand for client state if complexity grows

### 3. AI Model Selection
- **Choice**: GPT-4 for all AI operations
- **Reason**: Best performance for understanding governance context
- **Trade-off**: Higher latency and cost compared to smaller models
- **Future**: Fine-tune smaller models for specific tasks

### 4. Authentication System
- **Choice**: Wallet-based authentication only
- **Reason**: Natural fit for blockchain interaction
- **Trade-off**: Limited user management capabilities
- **Future**: Add traditional auth for non-blockchain features
